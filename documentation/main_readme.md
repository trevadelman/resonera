# Resonera: Advanced Brainwave Entrainment Platform

## Overview
Resonera is a cutting-edge application that combines neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and audio processing to enhance learning, relaxation, and cognitive performance. By leveraging precise frequency generation and advanced brainwave entrainment techniques, the platform creates personalized audio experiences that guide users into optimal brain states for their desired outcomes.

## Scientific Foundation

### Brainwave Entrainment Technology
Our platform utilizes multiple entrainment methods:
- **Binaural Beats**: Precisely calibrated frequency differences between ears (requires headphones)
- **Isochronic Tones**: Rhythmic pulsing of a single tone, effective with or without headphones
- **Harmonic Layering**: Multiple frequencies in mathematical relationships for enhanced effectiveness

### Targeted Brain States
The application can induce various beneficial brainwave patterns:
- **Delta (0.5-4 Hz)**: Deep sleep, healing, subconscious programming
- **Theta (4-8 Hz)**: Enhanced learning, creativity, memory consolidation
- **Alpha (8-14 Hz)**: Relaxed focus, stress reduction, light meditation
- **Gamma (30-100 Hz)**: Peak cognitive performance, problem-solving
- **Custom Frequencies**: Targeted states based on user needs

### Safety Considerations
The platform incorporates multiple safety features:
- Frequency range limiters to prevent harmful resonances
- Photosensitivity protection algorithms
- Volume normalization and dynamic range control
- Automated session length monitoring
- Contraindication checking for certain medical conditions
